# Codeforces Problem Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various Codeforces problems. All solutions are implemented in C++.

## Directory Structure

Solutions are organized in the `/CODEFORCES PROBLEMS` directory. Each file is named according to the problem ID and name.


## Common Template

All solutions use a common template that includes:
- Standard C++ libraries
- Common macros and type definitions
- Fast I/O optimization
- Debugging helpers
- Common constants and utility functions

## Usage

Each solution can be compiled and run independently. The solutions are written to be submitted directly to Codeforces.

```cpp
// Example compilation
g++ -std=c++17 solution.cpp -o solution
